/**
 * 
 * Derived types must be completely substitutable for their base types
 * 
 * It means that the classes fellow developer created by extending your class 
 * should be able to fit in application without failure. 
 * I.e. if a fellow developer poorly extended some part of your class and injected 
 * into framework/ application then it should not break the application or should not 
 * throw fatal exceptions.
 * 
 * This can be insured by using strictly following first rule. 
 * If your base class is doing one thing strictly, the fellow developer will 
 * override only one feature incorrectly in worst case. 
 * This can cause some errors in one area, but whole application will not do down.
 * 
 * Violations of LSP cause undefined behaviour. 
 * Undefined behaviour means that it works okay during development but blows up 
 * in production, or that you spend weeks debugging something that only occurs 
 * once per day, or that you have to go through hundreds of megabytes of logs to 
 * figure out what went wrong.
 * 
 * eg Set should not extend from ArrayList 
 * Square should not extend from Rectangle
