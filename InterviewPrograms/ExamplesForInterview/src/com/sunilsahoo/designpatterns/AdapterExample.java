/**
 * categories: Structural
 * 
 * ## Also known as Wrapper
 * 
 * ## Intent Convert the interface of a class into another interface the clients
 * expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of
 * incompatible interfaces.
 * 
 * 
 * ## Applicability Use the Adapter pattern when
 * 
 * you want to use an existing class, and its interface does not match the one
 * you need you want to create a reusable class that cooperates with unrelated
 * or unforeseen classes, that is, classes that don't necessarily have
 * compatible interfaces you need to use several existing subclasses, but it's
 * impractical to adapt their interface by subclassing every one. An object
 * adapter can adapt the interface of its parent class.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Adapter pattern works as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces. This
 * type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern
 * combines the capability of two independent interfaces. This pattern involves
 * a single class which is responsible to join functionalities of independent or
 * incompatible interfaces. A real life example could be a case of card reader
 * which acts as an adapter between memory card and a laptop. You plugin the
 * memory card into card reader and card reader into the laptop so that memory
 * card can be read via laptop.
 * 
 * ## Real world examples java.util.Arrays#asList(), BaseAdapter
